## Featured Work

### Blurb

I worked on overhauling segments of blurb.com, with performance, accessibility, and the use of modern tech stacks/utilities in mind; the objective was to do frontend migration from ERB/Ember server-side rendered pages to a frontend single page application (SPA) with dedicated API Gateways.

In a previous life, I've worked on this website by creating and integrating WordPress plugins, and extending and managing the overall site theme and look. My main task as a developer was to translate high-fidelity wireframes and mocks, to an interactive and production-ready website.

As part of hackathon, I worked on a proof-of-concept single page application for viewing and managing e-commerce insights via WooCommerce.

My role as a developer was to create custom RESTful APIs on the backend, and design + implement the frontend feature bits such as async data fetching, error handling, dataset sorting, and filtering.
