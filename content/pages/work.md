Starting as a freelance developer, I've contracted with multiple awesome companies and taken on some cool projects to hone my know-how with various web tools and technologies.

As of current, I am _happily_ employed as a Front End Engineer at [Blurb](https://blurb.com), where I
get to work on using React to perform frontend SPA migrations.

## Featured Work

### Blurb

I am currently working on improving the overall look, and performance of the company's webpages.

In recent efforts to transition from an MVC-model to a microservice-driven approach, we are performing a frontend migration from ERB/Ember server-side rendered pages to a frontend single page application (SPA) combined with dedicated API Gateways.

In a previous life, I've worked on this website by creating and integrating WordPress plugins, and extending and managing the overall site theme and look. My main task as a developer was to translate high-fidelity wireframes and mocks, to an interactive and production-ready website.

### WooCommerce Dashboard Metrics

As part of hackathon, I worked on a proof-of-concept single page application for viewing and managing e-commerce insights via WooCommerce.

My role as a developer was to create custom RESTful APIs on the backend, and design + implement the frontend feature bits such as async data fetching, error handling, dataset sorting, and filtering.
